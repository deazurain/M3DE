LJWGL will need to be configured with eclipse before you are able to build M3DE.

To do this, go to the project properties and select 'Java Build Path'. There you
can switch to the 'Libraries' tab and select 'Add JAR' from the menu on the
right. Select the three libraries in 'M3DE/lib/lwjgl-x.x.x/jar'. 

Then you need to set the correct native libraries for your operating system for 
LWJGL in eclipse. You can do this by expanding the lwjgl-x.x.x.jar item and 
editing 'Native library location'. The natives can be found in the 'native' 
folder in the LWJGL folder. 

I believe that is about all you need to do.
